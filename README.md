# News-Aggregator
This project is an automated MERN web application that utilizes web scraping and AI to both determine and summersize the daily news of any given day from various news outlets. The number of sources and their respective links are displayed below the summaries with their matching news logos. This data is then saved in a database, allowing for past headlines to be viewed given a specified date.

This project was made not just to exercise my skills as a developer, but also as an example of how quick and easy getting your daily scoop of current events is while also being able to gauge the popularity of certain news.

### Tech Stack
- **React** for FrontEnd
- **Express** & **Node.js** for BackEnd 
- **MongoDB** for storing past events
- **Playwright** for Web Scraping
- **Gemini** for AI data processing


### Visit the Site

This project is currently being hosted on free Render servers and thus has a small wait time (around 30 seconds) for BackEnd services to spin up upon new users visiting.
